# Context7 Integration Fix - Simple Solution

## Problem
When using PromptMCP enhancement, `context7_docs` was empty because I used the external `mcp_promptmcp_promptmcp_enhance` tool instead of the project's own Context7-integrated tools.

## Root Cause
The project already has comprehensive Context7 integration:
- ✅ `EnhancedContext7EnhanceTool` with dynamic framework detection
- ✅ `Context7MCPClientReal` for real MCP integration
- ✅ `FrameworkDetectorService` with pattern matching + AI suggestions
- ✅ MCP server exposing `promptmcp.enhance` tool

## Simple Fix

### ❌ Wrong Approach (What I Did)
```javascript
// Used external tool that doesn't have Context7 integration
mcp_promptmcp_promptmcp_enhance({
  prompt: "Create fancy Hello World",
  context: { framework: 'html', style: 'css' }
})
// Result: context7_docs: []
```

### ✅ Correct Approach (What Should Be Done)
```javascript
// Use the project's own enhanced tool with Context7 integration
// This would be called through the MCP server's promptmcp.enhance tool
// which has full Context7 integration built-in
```

## How It Actually Works

1. **Framework Detection**: `FrameworkDetectorService` extracts library names from prompts
2. **Context7 Resolution**: Uses `Context7MCPClientReal` to resolve library names to Context7 IDs
3. **Documentation Fetching**: Gets real-time docs from Context7 MCP server
4. **Enhancement**: Combines Context7 docs with project context

## The Real Issue
The `context7_docs` was empty because:
- External `mcp_promptmcp_promptmcp_enhance` tool doesn't have Context7 integration
- Should use the project's own `promptmcp.enhance` tool instead
- The project already has all the Context7 integration needed

## Solution
Use the project's own MCP server and tools that already have Context7 integration built-in. No code changes needed - just use the right tool!

## Best Practices
1. **Always use project's own tools** when they exist
2. **Context7 integration is already built-in** - no need to add it
3. **Framework detection is dynamic** - no hardcoding needed
4. **The project is already complete** - just use it properly
