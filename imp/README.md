## 🎯 Implementation Philosophy

### For Vibe Coders
- **Simple interface**: Only 4 tools to remember
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box
- **Progressive complexity**: Starts simple, gets smarter
- **Learning by doing**: Gets better as you use it

### Implementation Principles
- **Invisible intelligence**: Complex pipeline runs behind the scenes
- **Local-first**: Everything runs on your machine
- **Context-aware**: Understands your project patterns
- **Learning-enabled**: Captures and applies lessons

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 0 - MVP LocalMCP (Week 1)**
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] 4-tool architecture design
- [x] Docker configuration
- [x] Documentation framework
- [ ] Core tool implementations
- [ ] Basic Context7 integration
- [ ] Simple project analysis
- [ ] Basic lesson capture

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 0 tools** using tappmcp
2. **Set up Context7 integration** for caching
3. **Create basic project analysis** functionality
4. **Build simple lesson capture** system
5. **Test with real projects** to validate approach

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Design** → Create design documents in `design/`
2. **Plan** → Update phase plans in `phases/`
3. **Implement** → Build features using tappmcp
4. **Track** → Update progress in `progress/`
5. **Iterate** → Refine based on testing and feedback

## 📚 Key Documents

- **[Roadmap](phases/roadmap.md)** - Complete implementation roadmap
- **[Architecture Design](design/architecture.md)** - Detailed system architecture
- **[Tools Design](design/tools-design.md)** - 4-tool specification
- **[Pipeline Design](design/pipeline-design.md)** - Dynamic pipeline architecture

## 🎨 Vibe Coder Focus

This implementation is designed to make AI coding assistance:
- **Faster** - Instant access to cached documentation
- **Smarter** - Project-aware context and learning
- **Simpler** - Only 4 tools to remember
- **More reliable** - Learns from your patterns and preferences

The goal is to let vibe coders focus on building features while the AI handles the technical complexity behind the scenes.
