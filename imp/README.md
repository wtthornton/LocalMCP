## 🎯 Implementation Philosophy

### For Vibe Coders
- **Simple interface**: Only 2 tools to remember
- **Zero configuration**: Works out of the box
- **Progressive complexity**: Starts simple, gets smarter
- **Learning by doing**: Gets better as you use it

### Implementation Principles
- **Invisible intelligence**: Complex pipeline runs behind the scenes
- **Local-first**: Everything runs on your machine
- **Context-aware**: Understands your project patterns
- **Learning-enabled**: Captures and applies lessons

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase 0 - MVP LocalMCP (Week 1)** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] 3-tool architecture design (enhance, todo, breakdown)
- [x] Docker configuration
- [x] Documentation framework
- [x] Core tool implementations
- [x] Context7 integration (simplified)
- [x] Project analysis capabilities
- [x] Basic lesson capture

**Phase 1 - Testing Infrastructure** ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test suite implementation (23/23 passing tests)
- [x] Core service testing (SimpleContext7Client, PromptCacheService, FrameworkDetectorService)
- [x] Issue identification and resolution (10+ issues fixed)
- [x] Code coverage improvement (15% → 40%+)

**Phase 2 - Tool Testing** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] EnhancedContext7EnhanceTool tests
- [ ] HealthTool tests
- [ ] BreakdownTool tests

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Complete Tool Testing** - Add tests for main tools (EnhancedContext7EnhanceTool, HealthTool, BreakdownTool)
2. **Integration Testing** - MCP Server and Context7 integration tests
3. **Test Quality Improvements** - Shared test utilities and performance tests
4. **Documentation Updates** - Keep all docs in sync with code changes
5. **Performance Optimization** - Further improve response times and caching

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Design** → Create design documents in `design/`
2. **Plan** → Update phase plans in `phases/`
3. **Implement** → Build features using direct MCP implementation
4. **Track** → Update progress in `progress/`
5. **Iterate** → Refine based on testing and feedback

## 📚 Key Documents

- **[Roadmap](phases/roadmap.md)** - Complete implementation roadmap
- **[Architecture Design](design/architecture.md)** - Detailed system architecture
- **[Tools Design](design/tools-design.md)** - 4-tool specification
- **[Pipeline Design](design/pipeline-design.md)** - Dynamic pipeline architecture

## 🎨 Vibe Coder Focus

This implementation is designed to make AI coding assistance:
- **Faster** - Instant access to cached documentation
- **Smarter** - Project-aware context and learning
- **Simpler** - Only 2 tools to remember
- **More reliable** - Learns from your patterns and preferences

The goal is to let vibe coders focus on building features while the AI handles the technical complexity behind the scenes.
