# Roadmap â€” LocalMCP (Dynamic Pipeline Edition)

## Vision & Purpose
**Goal**: Create a simple, local Docker container that runs an MCP server to give **"vibe coders"** a **faster, more accurate, and more contextual AI coding assistant experience**.

**Target Audience**: "Vibe coders" - developers who:
- Code by intuition and feel rather than deep technical expertise
- Prefer AI assistance for complex technical decisions
- Want to focus on building features rather than learning every framework detail
- Need contextual help that understands their project's patterns
- Value speed and accuracy over having to research solutions themselves

**Why**: Current AI coding assistants like Cursor are powerful but suffer from:
- Slow context retrieval (repeated API calls to external docs)
- Generic responses not grounded in your specific project
- Lack of learning from your project's patterns and past fixes
- No access to your project's documentation and architectural decisions
- **Require expert-level knowledge to ask the right questions**

**Solution**: A local MCP gateway that:
- Caches external documentation locally (Context7) for instant access
- Indexes your project's docs, ADRs, and design decisions
- Learns from your coding patterns and successful fixes
- Provides project-aware context to the AI assistant
- **Works entirely locally (no external API dependencies during coding)**
- **Makes technical decisions easier by surfacing relevant context automatically**

## Vibe Coder Benefits
- **Less Googling**: Context7 cache means instant access to framework docs
- **Fewer Wrong Turns**: Lessons learned prevent repeating past mistakes
- **Faster Iteration**: Project-aware context means fewer back-and-forth with AI
- **Confidence Building**: AI suggestions are grounded in your actual project patterns

## Mission
Deliver **LocalMCP** - a simple, local MCP server for Cursor that:
- Grounds coding in repo facts, AGENTS.md directives, and versioned docs (Context7).
- Runs through a **dynamic pipeline** that adapts stage-by-stage.
- Reduces retries by learning from past errors (Lessons Learned).
- Optimizes speed and cost with a **local Context7 cache** (SQLite + LRU).
- Exposes only **4 simple tools** for maximum vibe coder friendliness.

## LocalMCP Tool Design

### Core Tools (Ultra-Simple for Vibe Coders)
- **`localmcp.analyze`** - "Look at my project" (analyzes project structure, dependencies, context)
- **`localmcp.create`** - "Make me something new" (creates code/components based on description)
- **`localmcp.fix`** - "Fix this problem" (fixes errors using cached docs and project context)
- **`localmcp.learn`** - "Remember this solution" (captures and applies lessons from patterns)

### Dynamic Pipeline Integration
The **dynamic pipeline runs invisibly** behind every tool call, providing:
- **Smart context retrieval** from Context7 cache and project RAG
- **Intelligent processing** with stage-by-stage adaptation
- **Quality validation** and best practices application
- **Pattern learning** and solution capture
- **Zero configuration** - works out of the box for vibe coders

### Vibe Coder Experience
```
User: "Create me a dark theme Hello World"
AI: *calls localmcp.create*
LocalMCP: *pipeline runs automatically*
  - Analyzes project (React/Next.js detected)
  - Gets dark theme best practices from Context7
  - Finds existing color schemes in project
  - Generates modern HTML with dark theme
  - Validates accessibility and contrast
  - Records the pattern for future use
AI: "Created! Here's your dark theme Hello World with proper contrast ratios."
```

## Phase 0 â€” MVP LocalMCP (Week 1)
- Implement **4 core tools**: `localmcp.analyze`, `localmcp.create`, `localmcp.fix`, `localmcp.learn`
- Connect Cursor to LocalMCP (one MCP endpoint)
- Basic Context7 integration for `localmcp.create` and `localmcp.fix`
- Simple project analysis for `localmcp.analyze`
- Basic lesson capture for `localmcp.learn`
- **Debug & Admin**: Basic health check endpoint, simple logging, tool call monitoring
- **Success Criteria**: Vibe coders can say "create me a dark theme Hello World" and get production-ready code

### Phase 0 Status: âœ… COMPLETE with Known Issues
- **Context7 Authentication Issue**: API key format invalid for direct REST access
- **Fallback Mode Active**: Using LocalMCP fallback responses instead of real Context7 data
- **Impact**: LocalMCP fully functional, but without real-time documentation
- **Documentation**: See `imp/design/context7-integration-issues.md` for details

---
