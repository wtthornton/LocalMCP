  - [ ] Check cache service initialization
  - [ ] Verify cache storage (SQLite) is working
  - [ ] Test cache read/write operations
  - [ ] Review cache invalidation logic
  - [ ] Check cache key generation
- **Files to check**: `src/services/cache/`, database files
- **Success criteria**: Cache hit rate > 50% for repeated queries

#### Task 5: Debug Library Resolution
- **Issue**: `libraries_resolved: []` and `"name": "unknown"` - Not identifying React/TypeScript
- **Expected**: Should resolve React, TypeScript, CSS frameworks
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Test library detection on package.json
  - [ ] Verify dependency analysis logic
  - [ ] Check library mapping configuration
  - [ ] Test with Context7 library resolution
  - [ ] Review library caching mechanism
- **Files to check**: `src/services/`, library detection modules
- **Success criteria**: Libraries properly resolved as React/TypeScript

#### Task 6: Optimize Response Time
- **Issue**: `response_time: 1382` - 1.38 seconds is too slow
- **Expected**: < 500ms for simple enhancements
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Profile enhancement pipeline performance
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks in the process
  - [ ] Optimize database queries
  - [ ] Implement parallel processing where possible
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring
- **Files to check**: All enhancement pipeline components
- **Success criteria**: Response time < 500ms

### **Phase 3: System Integration (Medium Priority)**

#### Task 7: Test Framework Detection Service Integration
- **Issue**: Framework detection not feeding into enhancement system
- **Expected**: Detected framework should influence enhancement context
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Test framework detection service independently
  - [ ] Verify integration with enhancement pipeline
  - [ ] Check data flow from detection to enhancement
  - [ ] Test with different project types
  - [ ] Review service communication
- **Files to check**: `src/services/framework-detector/`
- **Success criteria**: Framework detection influences enhancement output

#### Task 8: Verify RAG Pipeline
- **Issue**: Project-specific knowledge not being retrieved
- **Expected**: RAG should provide project-specific context and patterns
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Test vector database queries
  - [ ] Verify document embedding process
  - [ ] Check similarity search algorithms
  - [ ] Test with project documentation
  - [ ] Review RAG service integration
- **Files to check**: `src/services/rag/`, Qdrant integration
- **Success criteria**: RAG provides relevant project context

### **Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Low Priority)**

#### Task 9: Create Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Issue**: No systematic testing of enhancement system
- **Expected**: Automated tests for all enhancement components
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Create unit tests for each service
  - [ ] Add integration tests for enhancement pipeline
  - [ ] Create performance benchmarks
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests with real prompts
  - [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
- **Files to create**: `test/enhancement/`
- **Success criteria**: > 90% test coverage for enhancement system

#### Task 10: Document Expected vs Actual Behavior
- **Issue**: No clear documentation of what enhancement should provide
- **Expected**: Clear documentation of expected enhancement output
- **Actions**:
  - [ ] Document expected JSON structure
  - [ ] Create examples of proper enhancement output
  - [ ] Document debugging procedures
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] Add monitoring and alerting documentation
- **Files to create**: `docs/enhancement-debugging.md`
- **Success criteria**: Clear documentation for debugging and maintenance
